# PsychePath

This was my **shity college hackathon project** in which I somehow secured **4th rank** at **Technovation**.

The idea? You play a bunch of small games, make choices, and based on your actions, we generate a **psychological report of your brain** - all very “sciencey” but held together with duct tape and caffeine.

I was the **backend guy**. My job was to take all those random player choices, run them through our highly sophisticated (read: barely working) logic, and spit out a “profile” that made it look like we actually knew what we were doing.

Was it perfect? Nope. Was it fun? Absolutely. Did it get us free snacks at the event? You bet.
